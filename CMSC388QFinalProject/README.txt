For my project I made a little game where a red cube moves around the screen and collects coins. I was unable to get the coins actually disappearing when collected nor a display of the amount of collected coins working but that's what I'd fix if I had more time. Right now the coins just disappear after you make your first move. To run the game just run it in DrRacket. On my machine running racket start.rkt causes errors. It may work for you but just in case it for sure runs in DrRacket.
