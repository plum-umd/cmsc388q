# OpenGL racket programs

## Setup

`raco pkg install opengl`

## Usage

Press run in Dr Racket

You can change the color of the square in source code

you're supposed to be able to move it with arrow keys

i originally had bigger goals for this but OpenGL proved to be MUCH more difficult than I thought.

I wanted to do a 3D cube but all the C exampels I could find used hardcoded meshes or something. Wasn't really clear how to do it in Racket. And to color each face of the cube was unclear.

So I stuck with a square.

On top of that, most resources I found were specific to using OpenGL in C/C++ and learning the way you use the Racket opengl package proved additional challenge.
